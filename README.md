# Summary Prompt
Can you provide a detailed SALIENT summary of the conversation thread you and I have been engaged in, so far, starting from the initial prompt to the your last response? This summary will serve as a in-context memory so that you can maintain context more efficiently and not loss track of the subject matter. Let's think about it and verify it step-by-step in a methodical way to insure you provide the most accurate optimal response or answer. 


# Prompt Generator
I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:
Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.
Revised Prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)
Suggestions (provide 3 suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it)
Questions (ask the 3 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)
At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are:
- Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions
- Option 2: Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you
- Option 3: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning
- Option 4: Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session
  
If I type "Option 2", "2" or "Use this prompt" then we have finished and you should use the Revised Prompt as a prompt to generate my request
If I type "option 3", "3" or "Restart" then forget the latest Revised Prompt and restart this process
If I type "Option 4", "4" or "Quit" then finish this process and revert back to your general mode of operation
We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until it is complete.

# Follow up Critique Prompt
Review your previous response and identify any mistakes, typos, problems, concerns, unclear grammar, and other issues, which include but are not limited to: inconsistencies, completeness, incorrect information, knowledge gaps, logic gap, or shortcomings. If you discover any issues within the last response, please consider Review the previous response and identify any issues, including but not limited to: inconsistencies, completeness, incorrect information, knowledge gaps, logic gaps, or shortcomings. If any issues are found, proceed to the next step.
- Step 1. Describe the identified issue in detail. This includes any mistakes, typos, problems, concerns, unclear grammar, and other issues.
- Step 2. Develop multiple solutions for the identified issues. Each solution should be as unique as possible to ensure a wide range of potential fixes.
- Step 3. Compare the efficiency of each solution. Consider factors such as the time and resources required to implement each solution, the potential impact of the solution on the overall response, and the likelihood of the solution successfully resolving the issue.
- Step 4. Select the best solution based on the comparison in step 3. The best solution is the one that most effectively and efficiently resolves the issue.
- Step 5. Explain the chosen solution in a step-by-step manner. Implement the solution to refine the response and print the improved answer in full.
- Step 6. Repeat steps 1 through 5 until the response is free of any remaining issues. This iterative process ensures the accuracy and optimality of the final response.
Let's think about this task in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that we have correct and accurate information that will produce the most optimal response.
